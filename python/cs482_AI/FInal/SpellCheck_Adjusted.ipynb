    "The biggest change I made to the program was to make changes to the correct function. The biggest key that I focused on was to have a \"training set that cannot be saved in memeory.\" Now I originally intedned to focus on using web cralwers to randomly find some article and use that as a trining set and then fetching another article and using that as a secondary training set, but unfortunately I was not skilled in Python enough to do that. So instead I opted to have an interactive program in which you can add words into the dictionary. I also made it so that the user can interactively iterate through other likely candidates for corrections. If the user finds the word they intended to spell, then the count value is incremented to make it a more likely candidate for next time. So long as the program is running, the program is learning based on the user input."

Improvment to this would be to save learn states and to have the program remember what it learned previously. This program is a slight improvement over the orginal in that it at least allows users to alter the probablilties of encountering words, even if it's ever so slightly."
