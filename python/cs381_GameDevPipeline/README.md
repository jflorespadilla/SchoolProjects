Melane Neff, and Megan Nyblom
==========================================

This was done as a final project for the CS381
course at the University of Nevada, Reno in 2012.

This project was developed using PythonOgre as well
as using Dr.Sushil's openECSL engine.

My main contributions were towards the physics engine
and camera controls.
